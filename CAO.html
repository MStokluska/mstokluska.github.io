<p class="indent justify">CAO which is  a Central Application Office. CAO are the people who are a first link between you and your dream third level education institute. They have lists of all available courses and their website is very user friendly but you must find courses ID numbers yourself (from each college website). You must also be aware of deadlines and be very careful at completing their online application. <b>You must complete <a href="https://www.cao.ie/apply.php "target="_blank">CAO application form</a> in order to obtain CAO number and it must be done before <a href="https://www.cao.ie/?page=timetableevents&bb=importantdates" target="_blank">deadline date</a>.</b> Then let CAO go through the list of your picked courses. It is important to select as many as you can courses for your CAO application form as it might happen that you will not get the one you picked as priority but you might be accepted for a different one from your list - it is important to remember that if there will be only one course on your course pick list, and you won't meet the requirements, CAO will automaticaly close your application.</p>
<p class="indent justify">First step is to find your college of choice, it is important to take time doing it as you will most likely spent next few years going to and out of the college. Commuting to college can be very expensive and as saving money should be one of yours priorities - choose well. Below are few tips that should help you find your best college.</p>
<p>For more information please visit official CAO website <a href="http://www.cao.ie/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Things to look out for when looking for a new college:</h3>	
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-12">
<ul class="list-unstyled">
<li>Picking profession rather than passion:</li>
<ul>
	<li>
	Study what you love, if you won't you will not only be unhappy at work but you will most likely be bad at it too. 	
	</li>
</ul>	
<li>
	Rushing the decision:</li>
<ul><li>February 1st is the deadline for most of full time courses, as you will have plenty of time while waiting for your chance of applying for BTEA. Mature students usually know exactly what they want but in case you missed it somehow, follow the <a href="choosingcarrer.html">link</a> and visit our Choosing right career site.  </li></ul>
<li>Making narrow course choices</li>
<ul><li>Choose many courses, the more you choose the more chances you have to get back to education. Of course prioritize your choices but include as many as you can</li></ul>
<li>Forgeting about references</li>
<ul><li>As mature student you will need to collect your previous jobs references. At some stage you will have to fill in a form that will require your experiance information. It's good practice to keep your references in order as you might need it.</li></ul>
