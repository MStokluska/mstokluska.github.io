<p class="indent justify">Student Universal Support Ireland is another organization that supports students financially. First of all, how much of financial support are you going to get from SUSI depends entirely on your previous year gross income, or at least this is what SUSI website points out. However, when filling in SUSI application form - which you can start filling in around april - be honest with them. SUSI is there for you, so be honest with them and if your situation is very difficult this year, although you had good previous year, they might still help you out. For most cases, SUSI covers college fees but also supports every month with few hundred euro, that extra monthly payment is only when you didn't receive your BTEA. This little bit really helps when you are struggling, depending on your situation. Whatever you do, remember, SUSI is there to support you. For more information go to <a href="https://susi.ie/" target="_blank">www.susi.ie</a>
	</p>
	<p class="indent justify">Another financial support you might be eliglibe to get is your college financial support, some colleges in Ireland do give that extra payment once a year, it might not be much but definitely something that is worth a while to fill in the long and exhausting form to get it! For more information about college support visit your Student Life and Learning center.</p>
