	<p class="indent justify">Social Welfare System in Ireland offers a lot of support for people who would like to go back to education and are unemployed. Main scheme is called Back To Education Allowance and is available for people over 24 years of age, however, person has to be unemployed for at least 9 months before being eliglible for BTEA. This is very often pushing people away as being unemployed for such a long time doesn't suit everyone. BTEA works just like Job Seeker's Benefit or Job Seeker's Allowance with the only difference is not having to visit local Intreo offices for so called "activation meetings". If you are employed however, you will not be eliglible for BTEA. Although this system doesn't make much sense to us as it promotes leaving current job in order to get BTEA, it's there to support you if you need it. Below table shows a guide on what steps you need to take in order to receive BTEA if you were unfortunate to lose your job. Forms can be downloaded and completed at home, however we suggest to contact your <a href="http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Intreo-Centres-and-Local-and-Branch-Offices.aspx" target="_blank">local Intreo office</a> as these forms are frequently updated. </p>
