This is my final HTML project for semester 2 of year 2 at Waterford Institute of Technology BSc in Information Technology

Programme was created using Dreamweaver, CSS and Bootstrap.

Purpose of the website:
This is my final project for Web Design and Testing in my first year. As mature foreign applicant for Back To Education I found the
amount of forms and different offices that I needed to get in touch with, daunting and exhausting, back then I came up with the idea of 
having all-in-one place for all the required information and forms, for people that are in the same circumstances as I was. For my final
project from Web Design and Testing I was given an opportunity to come up with a company and a website. So I have made up a 
company Life Matters, their logo and slogan. Life Matters helps mature applicants to get back to college. Website contains all-in-one information from start of the application (Social Welfare) up to first day at college. Scaling does not work perfectly but it is viewable on different devices, mobile phone, ipad, and different screen resolutions.
