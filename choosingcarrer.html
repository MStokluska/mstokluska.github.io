	<div class="col-sm-4 text-center"><h3>Personality Test</h3>
	<p class="justify">Altough personality test might seems like a good idea, it is very often generalized and does not reflect true You. However, it's always good to try one as you never know what you might find out about yourself. Click on the link below to try one of the free personality tests online</p><p><a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test" target="_blank">Personality Test</a></p></div>
	<div class="col-sm-4 text-center"><h3>Career Quiz</h3><p class="justify">Just as much as with personality test career quizes don't necessarily represent the reality. It's always fun to complete one but be careful, as if you have an idea of what you would like to do and it matches with quiz - Great! If not, you might be negatively suprised as to what should you be doing according to quiz. </p>
